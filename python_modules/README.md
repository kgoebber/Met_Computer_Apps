# Python Modules

The power of Python comes not only from the languages inherent flexibility and clear syntax, but from the collection of specialized packages (modules) that contain functions and methods that greatly extend the programming power of the language. There are a substantial number of packages that create exciting functionality for all sorts of disciplinary work including meteorology. This text will cover only a few of the modules that are most widely used and accessible within a relatively small amount of time. The key to becoming skilled at using computers will be your ability to take introductory knowledge of a programming language and a few of its modules and read the documentation of other modules and understand what they are saying. This will not happen overnight, but hopefully by the end of this work you'll be a little closer to figuring new tools out on your own.

Key Modules for Meteorology Covered Here:
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Cartopy
* datetime
* netCDF
* MetPy
