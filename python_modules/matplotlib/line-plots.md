### Line Plots

There are many different types of plots that can be made via the matplotlib module, but one of the most common types of plots is a simple line plot. In meteorology these plots are often time series visualizations of data, whether that be observations (e.g., meteorograms), model output (e.g., forecast meteorograms), or statistical aspects of weather and climate observations.
