## Matplotlib

The Matplotlib module is a primarily 2D plotting package that can create publication-quality graphics that largely grew our of a community that wanted MATLAB-like graphics available within the Python ecosystem. (The name Matplotlib is shorthand for MATLAB plot library.) They aim of this package, according to their website, is to make easy things easy and hard thing possible with the use of the functions and methods available through the module. All of the documentation for Matplotlib is available on their [website](https://matplotlib.org), which is quite extensive and includes are great [gallery of examples](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html).

The main plotting module is [pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_summary.html) and the common import function is
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

There are other plotting modules that are available if you look around. Matplotlib is one of the most common in the scientific Python stack and is the most widely used plotting library in the atmospheric sciences.
