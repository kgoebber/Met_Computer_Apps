## Welcome and Objective

Welcome to MET 330: Meteorological Computer Applications!

This online textbook is designed to introduce basic computer programming topics in Fortran and Python programming languages to enable you to use either or both languages to answer meteorological questions.

This textbook will evolve over the course of the summer and throughout the fall semester. Really, throughout its entire life as the technology covered in this book is continually changing.
